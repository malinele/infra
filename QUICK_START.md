# 🚀 Quick Start - Fixed Docker Compose Setup

## ✅ All Issues Resolved!

The Docker Compose configuration has been completely fixed. All services are now properly included in the main `docker-compose.yml` file.

## 🎯 How to Run (Simple)

### **Option 1: Enhanced Startup Script (Recommended)**
```bash
cd /app
./scripts/start-dev.sh
```

### **Option 2: Standard Docker Compose**
```bash
cd /app
docker-compose up -d
```

### **Option 3: Manual Step-by-Step**
```bash
cd /app

# Start infrastructure first
docker-compose up -d postgres redis elasticsearch nats minio

# Wait a moment, then start applications
docker-compose up -d

# Check status
docker-compose ps
```

## 📍 Service URLs (All Working)

- **🌐 API Gateway:** http://localhost:8080/health
- **🔐 Auth Service:** http://localhost:3001/health
- **👤 User Service:** http://localhost:3002/health
- **🎮 Coach Service:** http://localhost:3003/health
- **📅 Session Service:** http://localhost:3004/health
- **📹 Video Service:** http://localhost:3005/health
- **💬 Messaging Service:** http://localhost:3006/health
- **💳 Payment Service:** http://localhost:3007/health
- **⭐ Ratings Service:** http://localhost:3008/health
- **🔍 Search Service:** http://localhost:3009/health

## 🔧 Common Commands

```bash
# Check all service status
docker-compose ps

# View logs for all services
docker-compose logs -f

# View logs for specific service
docker-compose logs -f auth-service

# Restart a service
docker-compose restart auth-service

# Stop everything
docker-compose down

# Stop and remove volumes
docker-compose down -v

# Rebuild and start
docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d
```

## 🧪 Test Everything Works

```bash
# Run verification tests
./scripts/verify-infrastructure.sh

# Run smoke tests
./scripts/smoke-tests.sh

# Test Docker Compose config
./scripts/test-docker-compose.sh
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Don't use the `local-dev/docker-compose.dev.yml` file** - it's deprecated
2. **All services are in the main `docker-compose.yml`** - no need for separate files
3. **The version field has been removed** - Docker Compose no longer requires it
4. **Health checks are configured** - Services wait for dependencies to be ready

## 🎉 What's Fixed

- ✅ All 15 services properly configured
- ✅ Network connectivity working
- ✅ Volume mounts for development
- ✅ Health checks and dependencies
- ✅ Environment variables complete
- ✅ No more version field warnings
- ✅ Proper startup order

The platform is now ready for development! 🚀
